My solutions to Advent of Code 2022

* All solutions are in C++
* Each day solution is in a self contained main.cpp file (no headers, no data file read at runtime)
* Each day is in its own directory dayn , where n is 1,2,3,...25
* Each main.cpp is tested to compile in gcc12 and clang-15 on macOS.
* Some days have a take2.cpp with an alternative solution that requires C++20 features like ranges, coroutines etc...
* This repository comes with a root VScode configuration. 
* The VSCode configurations come with hard coded builds for macOS gcc-12 and clang-15 installed with brew or native (defined by each distribution)
